**This is an Open Source, realtime scorecard built for Overwatch + Live Streaming!**

Feel free to follow me on twitch for more projects like this
http://www.twitch.tv/InclementDeath

**Features**
* StartSR / CurrentSR Tracker, along with a difference tracker
* Customizable output
* Log in with BattleNET to retrieve your current SR (note your game must be restarted for this to be updated, which is why it is not realtime.. yet...)
* Effortlessly track Win Streaks, or Loss Streaks! Dont worry about having to constantly edit that text file after every game

**Install Instructions:**
<p>1.) Download ZIP Version of file</p>
<p>2.) Extract the WinLossCounter.exe to your desired location</p>
<p>3.) Run program (the app will prompt for you to save a "*.txt" file. This is the output of the Scorecard)</p>
<p>4.) Enjoy! I have included a syntax list below if you want to customize the message I have preset in the app itself.</p>
