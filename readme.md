## What is OW-Scorecard?
Overwatch Scorecard is an Open Source, realtime scorecard built for Overwatch + Live Streaming. The software is designed to manage a text file of your choice, and allow you to easily track Wins/Losses/Draws, along with SR, WinStreaks, and more.

### Features
* StartSR / CurrentSR Tracker, along with a difference tracker
* Customizable output
* Log in with BattleNET to retrieve your current SR (note your game must be restarted for this to be updated, which is why it is not realtime.. yet...)
* Effortlessly track Win Streaks, or Loss Streaks! Dont worry about having to constantly edit that text file after every game

### Install Instructions:
<p>1.) Download ZIP Version of file</p>
<p>2.) Extract the WinLossCounter.exe to your desired location</p>
<p>3.) Run program (the app will prompt for you to save a "*.txt" file. This is the output of the Scorecard)</p>
<p>4.) Enjoy! I have included a syntax list below if you want to customize the message I have preset in the app itself.</p>
